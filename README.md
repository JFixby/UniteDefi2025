## Requirements for Lightning Network

To run the Lightning Network components in this project, you will need:

- **Docker**: Containerization platform for running services.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **Polar**: GUI tool for creating and managing Lightning Network regtest environments.

Please ensure all three are installed on your system before attempting to run the Lightning Network setup.
