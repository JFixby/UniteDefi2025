Task for this hackaton:

Extend Fusion+ to Bitcoin 
Qualification Requirements:
- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet/L2 or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo (EVM testnets will require the deployment of Limit Order Protocol contracts)
Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
- UI
- Enable partial fills

Intro matherials:
in project root there are folders:
cross-chain-sdk - that offers code for fusion and fusin plus implementation - use this code as reference
we have whitepaper.txt with the idea
we preer to use Polygon network for this demo as the transactions are cheaper there
in file SECRETS.py you can find private keys you need to run the demo

Proposed idea:

use lightning network to swap between BTC net and 1inch (polygon net)
lightning network test net is alredy configured in LN folder
